Completed this project as a part of my BI with PowerBI internship with UNP. It provides a data visualisation showing the impact of several factors on attrition based on HR Data. To clarify the same, we have designed a dashboard with a variety of slicers, cards, and charts.

Key highlights:
1) Contributed in the creation of complex KPIs and dynamic, interactive Power Bl user interfaces.
2) Acquired the ability to examine data and transform it into useful Power BI solutions.
3) Enhanced proficiency in developing data models, applied DAX for data transformations and computations to provide precise analysis and reporting.
4) Lead the group through the intricate information symphony.
